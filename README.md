When you run the application, the web browser shows nothing than a page "Not found" or something like that
Don't worry. If you want to register an account, please add Home/Register to the current URL on web browser
If you want to log in,please add Home/LogOn
After you login, you want to edit profile, please add Profile/editProfile
If you know MVC, all stuffs above will make sense to you hopefully. It is just program for testing.
